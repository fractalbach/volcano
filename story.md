Volcano Story
=====================

There are many who believe volcanos are alive.  Geologists who study
them don't often agree, because they tend to define life by the
current scientific definition of organic molecules and such.  Most
Organic life forms will tell you that they think volcanos are hot, but
they wouldn't want to date one.  (However, There's definitely a
geologist out there who has who claims to have dated many.)


This type of life is not organic, but is as alive as the earth itself.
Some go so far as saying 'It IS the earth itself'.  These volcanic
life are often very calm, but occasionally have a very bad temper,
much to the disapproval of the organic lifeforms that live nearby.
