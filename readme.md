# Volcano Game

Travel through the volcano game!  A simple adventure game where you
battle your way through a randomly generated graph, where each node in
the graph is a room.  As you navigate your way through the volcano,
you must decide whether you can survive the room, or must go back and
find a new path.

## Map Features

You start outside the volcano, noticing features created by previous
erruptions.  These help you identify a way to enter the volcano.
You usually enter through a vent or a lava cave entrance.  Once
you are inside the volcano, you are mostly inside different kinds
of lava caves.  Eventualy, you traverse you way into the main
magma chamber through the conduit.
