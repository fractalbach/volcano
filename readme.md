# Volcano Game

Travel through the volcano game!  A simple adventure game where you
battle your way through a randomly generated graph, where each node in
the graph is a room.  As you navigate your way through the volcano,
you must decide whether you can survive the room, or must go back and
find a new path.



## Overview

- volcano map
	- random graph generator
	- link with key events in map
	- generated room names for humans
	- special rooms
- web display
	- buttons
		- for fighting or running.
		- movement-related buttons.
		- graph is built as you explore it.
	- message box for text-based version
	- vis.js for graph display
- combat system
	- very simple.
	- stats
	- monsters
	- player
	- randomized monster stats.




# Planned Features

(README poetically.)

Everything else below this point is planned for development, and is still
just bubbling underneath the surface of the volcano.  These ideas, like the
magma beneath a volcano, will soon erupt to the surface, covering the volcano
game in a fiery hot development layer of experiment: but later cooling in a
solid layer of great features.  
Producing a new and beautiful volcano game, built from the foundations of the
previous volcano, but new and different on the surface.


(that's right, I just compared software engineering to a volcano.)



## Map Features and Names

Randomly generated naming system for rooms and areas based on volcano related
terms.  These names (especially if used in the right places) can make the Game
feel much more like a volcano.

You start outside the volcano, noticing features created by previous
eruptions.  These help you identify a way to enter the volcano.
You usually enter through a vent or a lava cave entrance.  Once
you are inside the volcano, you are mostly inside different kinds
of lava caves.  Eventually, you traverse you way into the main
magma chamber through the conduit.

## Items

Items can be used to craft weapons and armours while you are in
the volcano.  It is assumed that you already have a chisel, shovel,
and other basic tool.  Some items are used purely as treasure,
and can be considered loot.  Crystals and gems can be used as
magical items to heal you or do other neat things.


### Look at these for some ideas
- [Igneous rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igneous_rock)
	- extrusive - outside the volcano
	- intrusive - inside the volcano
- [Basalt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basalt)


### Craftable Materials
- obsidian
	- can use for arrows
